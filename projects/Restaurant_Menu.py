# Restaurant Menu Manager

# ? Objective
# Imagine you're a developer, and a local restaurant wants your help to manage their menu. They need a program to easily update their menu and count how many types of dishes (like appetizers, mains, desserts) they have.

# ? Steps:
# ? 1 Create the Menu:
#  Create a dictionary called menu with dish names as keys and tuples of dish type and price as values.
#  Start with these dishes: 'Burger', 'Soup', 'Ice Cream', 'Salad'.
# Example:
# {'Burger': ('Main', 10.5), 'Soup': ('Appetizer', 5.0)}

# ? 2 Add Dishes:
#  Add two more dishes: 'Steak' and 'Soda'.

# ? 3 Remove a Dish:
#  Remove one dish from the menu.

# ? 4 Display the Menu:
#  Write a function display_menu to show all dishes with their type and price.

# ? 5 Count Dish Types:
#  Write a function count_dish_types to count how many of each type of dish there are.

# ? 6 Update the Price:
#  Write a function update_price that changes the price of a dish.

# ? 7 Use All Functions:
#  Use the functions youâ€™ve created to manage the menu and show updated details.

# Expected Output Example:

# Display the initial menu.
# Show the count of dish types.
# Display the updated menu after changing the price of a dish.
